# WebScrapping_Project
Web scraping is a technique that involves extracting data from a website by automatically parsing its HTML content. In this project, I am using Python web scraping tools, such as Beautiful Soup and Scrapy, to extract data from a website.

The first step in web scraping is to identify the web page from which the data will be extracted. Once the target web page is identified, I write a Python script that specifies the HTML tags that need to be parsed. These tags correspond to the data I am interested in extracting from the webpage.

Next, I utilize Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Scrapy to parse the HTML content and extract the desired data. Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is used to extract data from HTML and XML files, while Scrapy is a web crawling framework that is designed to extract structured data from websites.

Overall, utilizing web scraping Python tools allows me to efficiently extract data from websites and integrate it into my projects.
